# Intro

In this comprehensive tutorial, we dive into the core features of React Query (now known as TanStack React Query),
and demonstrate how it simplifies **data fetching** and **state management** in your React applications.  

We'll delve into advanced topics like **caching**, **data invalidation**, and working with **mutations** to create and update data.  

# Why do we need TanStack Query?

- Because "**state management**" in a React app can be very complex.  
- Because constant "**refetching**" kills our app's performance

"TanStack React Query is the ultimate tool for effortless data fetching, caching, and real-time updates."
